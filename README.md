## BEAD: Location Max Service Level Sample Notebook

#### This notebook provides a repeatable and documented process to determine [Broadband Serviceable Location (BSL)](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/16842264428059-About-the-Fabric-What-a-Broadband-Serviceable-Location-BSL-Is-and-Is-Not) max service levels for a given state using FCC [Broadband Data Collection (BDC)](https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData) and [Location Fabric](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/5375384069659-What-is-the-Location-Fabric-) data.

## Purpose:

This notebook provides an overview of the key methodology and criteria used by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to determine location service levels for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. The sample code can be used to replicate this methodology for any given state with minimal resources, and to export the resulting [Broadband Serviceable Location (BSL)](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/16842264428059-About-the-Fabric-What-a-Broadband-Serviceable-Location-BSL-Is-and-Is-Not) service level data.
